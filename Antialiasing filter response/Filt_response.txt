freqz(b,1,[],fsup)

% the image is located near 2000 Hz, you need a steeper filter to remove the image. To improve the approximation of the filter, you can increase its order.  Use the filtord function, which returns the filter order:
ord = filtord(b)

% Resample the signal sig again, but this time, use a value of 30 for n so that the filter order is 360.
[sigup2, b2]  = resample(sig, 6, 1, 30)
freqz(b2,1,[],fsup)
periodogram(sigup2,w,[],fsup)		%we see that the magnitude of 2100 Hz is lesser (-60dB). But with higher order filter, delay is also more.

%Compare the group delay of both antialising filters on the same plot
grpdelay(b,1,[],fsup)
hold on
grpdelay(b2,1,[],fsup)
hold off
