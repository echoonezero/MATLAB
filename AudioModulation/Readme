This is a simple project describing modulation and adding a watermark to an audio file. The watermark can be used to prove ownership of the file.

moon1.wav is the main file to which carol1.wav is added as a watermark.

The process is as follows:
Modulate carol1.wav to a frequency greater than twice the frequency of moon1.wav. Scale the modulated signal to 1/1000th of amplitude because we need the frequency component to exist as a watermark but it should not be heard when added to moon1.wav.
Add the scaled signal to moon1.wav.

The spectrum of each audio file is available as well to know the frequency band of each audio signal.
